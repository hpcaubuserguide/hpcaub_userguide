Containerization
================

Currently Octopus supports containerized execution of jobs using Apprainer images (formerly known
as Singularity). Apprainer is a popular containerization technology in the HPC community due to its
ability to run containers without requiring elevated privileges, making it suitable for multi-user
environments like HPC clusters.
